          <h2 style="text-align:left"> CAREER OBJECTIVE &#128209; </h2>
     </div>
          <p> I am seeking a stimulating position within a reputable organization where I can apply my technical, database, 
          and management skills to contribute to the company's growth and stay up-to-date with emerging trends in the IT 
          industry. </p>

          <div style="background-color:#bafaff; padding: -3px;">
            <h2 style="text-align:left"> PROFESSIONAL MISSION &#127919; </h2>
       </div>
            <p> The development and advancement of my career aspirations is pivotal for me at this point in my life. 
                As such, my vision is to maximize my full professional potential. In pursuit of this, I intend to create 
                and establish my brand in the world of cybersecurity. As such, I intend to pursue a career as a freelance 
                cybersecurity analyst, assisting various organizations in implementing and/or strengthening their security systems. 
                I believe this contribution will be particularly helpful in Jamaica, who in recent years have seen several data and 
                security breaches in many companies/institutions island wide. In addition to my work as a freelancer, I also envision
                myself starting my own business venture within this field, with the intention of contracting and assigning individuals 
                or teams of cybersecurity analysts to various companies to aid in advancing their approach and implementation of data protection 
                policies, strategies and procedures. As a business owner, I intend to open several branches island wide, offering a wide range of 
                services accessible to both individuals and conglomerates. <br><br>

                Finally, as a part of my professional vision, I also intend to contribute to the development of Jamaican youth. I intend to 
                accomplish this by utilizing my acquired knowledge in information technology and cybersecurity as well as my experience as an entrepreneur, 
                to create initiatives geared towards informing youths about the various opportunities and career paths available in this information technology sphere. 
                In addition to this, I also intend to create internships so that upcoming analysts and programmers are provided with a space to network with other analysts, 
                gain work experience as well as develop their skill set by working actively in the field. Furthermore, I am committed to contributing to the enhancement of 
                cybersecurity in Jamaica by revolutionizing the way Jamaicans approach, implement and execute policies, procedures and laws related to data protection. In addition 
                to the aforementioned, my vision is to advocate for stricter penalties for those in breach of established data protection laws so as to encourage law enforcement and 
                governing bodies to earnestly protect the rights of our fellow digital citizens, whether on an individual or corporate level. </p>

         </div>
                 <p> My professional mission is to assist organizations in achieving their objectives through the effective use of technology. 
                        To accomplish this, I will maintain my professional skill set by keeping myself informed on the latest industry trends and 
                        best practices whilst being on the lookout for opportunities to innovate and enhance existing systems. Additionally, I will 
                        network with other industry leaders in order to establish fortified relationships with my colleagues and clients. Finally, I 
                        will prioritize the interests of my clients and the community in an effort to maintain the utmost standards of professionalism 
                        and integrity in my field of work. </p>

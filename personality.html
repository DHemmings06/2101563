     </div>
     <div style="background-color: #ffffff; padding: -3px;">
        <h3>Resilient</h3> (adjective)
         <p> Tending to recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or change; 
             the process and outcome of successfully adapting to difficult or challenging life experiences, especially through mental, emotional, and behavioral flexibility and adjustment to external and internal demands. </p>
            
         <h3>Empathetic</h3> (adjective)
         <p>Showing an ability to understand and share the feelings of another; the psychological identification with the emotions, thoughts, or attitudes of others. </p>
            
         <p>
            When I think of myself, two key words come to mind- resilience and empathy. As highlighted above, a resilient person is an individual that possess the ability to recover from shortcomings, quickly and effectively; and that is exactly the kind of person I am. 
            Despite the circumstances or conditions, I am determined to complete any task I am assigned, to the highest standard possible. In my opinion, the dynamic nature of life will always provide circumstances that are less than ideal. Being aware of this has helped me remain focused on my goals in times of adversity. 
            This mindset has also contributed to the development of a solution-oriented mindset. I am constantly planning, organizing and conceptualizing ways of overcoming the speedbumps carved in my journey. This personality trait has been extremely crucial in my academic success. 
            Being resilient has allowed me to maneuver the struggles of being a full-time employee and a university student, has given me strength during long late night sessions completing assignments and studying for exams as well as has allowed me to be creative, finding new and exciting ways to complete assigned tasks while balancing my spiritual and social life. 
            My resilience has also helped me stay grounded when completing group assignments, especially if my fellow group members are uncooperative. It has allowed me to go the extra mile for every task, assignment and/or goal, and has allowed me to set a precedence for producing work of a high standard and quality.
         </p>
         <p>
            Emotionally, I consider myself to be a very empathetic person. Whenever unpleasant situations arise, my first instinct is to analyze the situation from the opposing party’s perspective. 
            Not only has this practice helped me remain rational, but it has also aided me in maintaining a humble disposition. It has also greatly contributed to my academic success, particularly when I am required to operate in a group setting. 
            Conflicts easily arise in groups, as they comprise of individuals of varying socioeconomic backgrounds, various work attitudes and varying academic goals. Whenever there are clashes, as a result of these factors, I find being empathetic allows be to validate the feelings or concerns of my group members 
            and address them. This has allowed me to cultivate an environment within the group, where everyone feels heard and supported. Ultimately, this encourages the group to be more productive, efficient and effective when completing tasks.

        <h3 style="text-align:center"><i> “Do Your Best At It, or Don’t Do It At All!” </i></h3>
        <p>
            These words of wisdom have guided all 20 years of my life, and continues to be a principle I live by to this day. These words were first spoken by my hero, who happens to be my mother. 
            I admire my mother because she embodies what it means to be an independent, innovative and resilient woman. In reflecting on my relationship with my mother, I remember key moments in our lives that have highlighted my mother’s divine strength. 
            Particularly, I found it incredibly courageous how she led our household after the sudden and devasting passing of my grandparents, who passed only a few months apart. I cannot imagine how she must have felt during that time, becoming an orphan in the span of a couple months.
            Despite this, she effortlessly supported me and provided comfort all while processing her own grief. That was the defining moment when she transformed from mom to hero. My mother is a principle-based woman. She is of the belief that whatsoever you are tasked to do- whether to complete a big project or to do a simple task like sweeping the floor – it must be done to your best ability. 
            My mom believes that a true measure of a man’s character is how he/she conducts themselves, whether they are being acknowledged or not. That being said, her principle of doing and being the best you can possibly be, has been a beacon of encouragement throughout the pursuit of my university degree. It has been the guiding principle for how I treat my assignments as well as work projects. 
            Daily, I use this quote as a reminder than anyone can do the minimum, but being the best you can be, and maximizing your talents and potential will always be your distinguishing factor.

            A Personality Test is composed of a series of questions aimed at detecting and analyzing an individual’s personality type. Thousands of personality tests are used daily by individuals around the world for a plethora of reasons. 
            This is because many believe that one is able to fully understand their personality, and the traits that accompany a particular personality type. I believe that information garnered from personality tests can be used to improve 
            the interactions individuals have with others as well as help them assess their approach to life or conflict, and make adjustments if necessary. Thus, I believe there is some level of validity affixed to Personality Tests, and that 
            they can be quite transformative if the information it supplies is applied correctly. I too have used a personality test and can testify that the information it has supplied assisted me in understanding more about myself and my personality. 
            From the results of the test, I began to evaluate my entire life, my interactions with friends and family, my response to conflict, as well as how I handle my emotions. Ultimately, I was able to use this information to improve my quality of life 
            as I was able to pinpoint and adjust the way I manage select areas of my life. In closing, while personality tests are not a formal education tool, the results they yield are certainly valid and can be used to redirect the trajectory of an individual’s 
            life, for the better.
